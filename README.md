# SMART-GUN-INTERFACING-BIOMETRIC-SENSORS

A firearm is a portable weapon with a barrel that launches either projectile/s and is
often driven by the action of an explosive force. A smart gun is a firearm which can be
fired only when activated by an authorized user. The authorized and unauthorized users
are diagnosed in several different ways which includes the use of RFID chips,
fingerprint recognition devices, mechanical locks etc. This paper showcases the details
of integrating fingerprint biometric system with the firearm to improve the safety of
accessing it, which in turn reduces accidental firings and gun thefts. By implementation
of this technology, only license will be accessible to the firearm which further reduces
crimes. Smart gun technology has the potential to prevent stolen guns from being used
and, will additionally create a space for investigation during crimes by providing
firearm usage statistics such as time, date and location. Fingerprint reader and location
recorder are integrated with a microprocessor, the motherboard of the weapon, which
authorizes the user and sends signals to location recorder to store the location of a place
immediately after firing. Additionally, this data along with date and time stamp is stored
to a central cloud database which can be accessed by the police and investigation
departments whenever required. The other important thing to be noted is that this smart
weapon is no longer mechanically operated; elements such as the hammer, spring, and
lock are all replaced by an electromagnetic solenoid.
